Use Google Sheets Email Notifications (No Code)
ðŸ“Œ What it does:
Sends you (or your team) an email every time a new row is added (i.e., when someone signs up).

âœ… How to Set It Up:

1. Open your Google Sheet

2. Go to Extensions > Apps Script

3. Paste this code into the script editor:

function sendSignupNotification(e) {
  const row = e.values;
  const name = row[0]; // Assuming name is in column A
  const phone = row[1]; // Assuming phone is in column B
  const snack = row[2]; // Assuming snack is in column C

  const emailBody = `
    New Good Friday Signup:
    Name: ${name}
    Phone: ${phone}
    Snack: ${snack}
  `;

  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: "your_email@example.com",
    subject: "New Snack Signup - Good Friday",
    body: emailBody
  });
}

function createTrigger() {
  ScriptApp.newTrigger('sendSignupNotification')
    .forSpreadsheet(SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet())
    .onFormSubmit()
    .create();
}


4. Save it.

5. Run createTrigger() once to set up the listener.

6. âœ… Done! You'll now get email alerts when new signups come in.
